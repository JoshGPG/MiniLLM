# MiniLLM
MiniLLM is a beginner-friendly large language model project I built to explore the fundamentals of how LLMs work under the hood. The goal of this project wasnâ€™t to compete with state-of-the-art models, but to create a small-scale system where I could learn, experiment, and apply core concepts in natural language processing.
